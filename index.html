					<h1>INTRODUCTION :</h1>
					Hello everybody and welcome to VulnX.in, in this site we will be spreading all our knowledge about hacking and particularly about buffer overflow. We will be training you from the most basic level of having absolutely no knowledge about a buffer overflow, all the way up to making you capable of understanding and exploiting a vulnerability.<br><br>

					<hr class="new5">

					<h2>What is a buffer overflow?</h2>

					So you might be wondering, what actually is a buffer overflow. Well, a buffer is a section in memory allocated for the storage of 						data in future. When excess data [ more than what was expected to be stored ] is written into the buffer, it causes the excess 						data to be leaked/overflowed to the adjacent memory locations [ assuming ALSR to be disabled, you will learn about it in future 					tutorials ].<br><br>

					<hr class="new5">

					<h2>Why is it a big deal?</h2>

					The attacker can use a program which depends on user input by taking input through vulnerable functions like gets, read, strcpy, 						etc. The input which the attacker feeds to the program may contain memory address to change code execution or opcodes for 						instructions which ultimately help the attacker in changing the original purpose of the program.<br><br>

					<hr class="new5">

					<h2>Classification of buffer overflow</h2>
					A buffer overflow is generally of two types:<br>

						<ul>						

							<li><h3>Stack-Based</h3></li>
							<li><h3>Heap-Based</h3></li>

						</ul>						

					Heap-based buffer overflows are particularly difficult to target & exploit. So for the sake of simplicity, we will be covering 						the Stack-based buffer overflow.<br><br>

					<hr class="new5">
